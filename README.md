OOP Practice: Virtual Vending Machine in Command-Line. <b> Please see the JAVADOC <a href = ""> here </a> </b> 

# Program Overview
This program simulates a vending machine that sells soda and snacks. As you navigate the menu in the command-line you can purchase items by inserting quarters, dollars, or 5s. Change is then returned and the item is vended. The menu also allows personnel to restock inventory and currency (for change) in the machine when they're depleted.
